    <h2 class='section-heading'>About</h2>
    <p>
      Japanese kanji contain one radical each. 
      For example, you can see the radical of each j≈çy≈ç  
      kanji (Â∏∏Áî®Êº¢Â≠ó) on this <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji'>Wiki page</a>.
      <br>
      As you can see in the graphs above, here each kanji can contain multiple radicals ('building blocks'). 
      My hypothesis was that visualising kanji like this, i.e. using a force graph that naturally nudges kanji 
      which contain similar building blocks together, might help with kanji memorisation. 
      I also used the classification by concept by Wiki dataset to explore patterns between kanji belonging 
      to similar meaning categories and their constituent parts. 
      <br>
      It seems like some interesting clear patterns emerge, such the large number of appearances of 
      the radical <strong>ÂøÉ</strong> üíú in emotion-revealing kanji. In other cases, it‚Äôs harder to see a pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made the kanji graphs just for myself initially, but it grew into a more proper page. However, 
      I am just a humble student of Japanese, so don‚Äôt treat it as a rigorous language resource. 
      The page is also very slow. This is because it's made of thousands of svg shapes. I removed responsiveness for the grade graph 
      to speed it up a bit. I might re-do it a different way if there is interest, but in the meantime, be patient with it. 
      Wait a little bit when you click so that the kanji have time to arrange themselves in the final nice graph form. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, this page is <strong>hopefully</strong> a fun way to explore kanji and use radical patterns to 
      remember kanji more easily. Click around to discover what it does ‚ú®.
